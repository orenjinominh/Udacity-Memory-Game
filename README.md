# Memory Game: Intro to Programming Final Project

A Udacity project developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

# How the Game Plays:

This game tests your memory abilities by having you match each card's symbol with a corresponding pair. There are 16 cards to flip over (and consequently, 8 pairs to match to win the game.)

You can only flip over two cards at a time, and matched cards will stay flipped open. For every 15 clicks, a star is detracted from your ranking. A timer keeps track of how long it takes for you to match all of the cards.
